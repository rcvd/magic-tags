# Magic Tags
Magic Tags transforms the tags you specify into beautiful icons while preserving all functionality, such as backlinking and searching.

![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcvd/magic-tags/refs/heads/main/screenshots/magic-tags.gif)

- Icon Theme: Choose between Blueprint and Feather (Lucide) icon sets globally.
- Tag Name: The exact text of the tag (without #).
- Icon: Select an icon to replace the tag.
- Color: Choose from a variety of Blueprint colors. The extension automatically switches to a lighter variant when Roam is in dark mode or based on your system appearance setting (@media prefers-color-scheme: dark).
- Import/Export: Backup and restore your magic tag configurations easily via JSON files.

## Notes
You can use the same icon for multiple tags - with different colors if you like. An example of this would be a marker for high and critical tasks, which both would use the alert icon, but in yellow for high and red for critical.
