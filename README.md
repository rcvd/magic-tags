# Magic Tags

Magic Tags transforms tags you specify into beautiful icons while maintaining all functionality, like backlinking and searching.

## How does it work

- Select the Icon Theme. Blueprint is the default for Roam Research. Roam Studio provides Feather Icons.
- Select the first magic word - this is the name of the tag (e.g., if your tag is #love, your magic word is "love")
- Select an icon from the predefined list
- Select a color from the predefined list
- Select the lightness of the color

**Notes**
You can use the same icon for multiple tags - with different colors if you like. An example of this would be a marker for high and critical tasks, which both would use the alert icon, but in yellow for high and red for critical.
